**Tired of a cluttered photo gallery? Get organized with a swipe!**

CleanSweep is a powerful and private application for Android that helps you reclaim storage space and organize your photos and videos with a fun, simple, Tinder-like interface. Swipe right to keep, swipe left to delete. It's that easy.

Best of all, **CleanSweep is 100% offline.** Your files and your data never leave your device, ensuring your memories remain private.

## Key Features

CleanSweep is packed with smart features to make media management a breeze.

### The Fun & Easy Way to Organize
*   ✨ **Intuitive Swiping:** Quickly sort through thousands of files. Swipe right to keep, left to delete.
*   📁 **One-Tap Sorting:** Add your favorite folders, and they'll appear at the bottom of the screen. Simply tap a folder icon to instantly move the current photo or video.
*   ✂️ **Clip Video Moments:** Turn a favorite moment from a video into a still image with the built-in frame extractor.

### A Tailor-Made Experience

CleanSweep is built on the belief that your tools should work *your* way. The app features a comprehensive settings menu that lets you fine-tune nearly every aspect of the experience to match your personal workflow.

*   ⚙️ **Deep Customization:** From changing swipe sensitivity and theming to controlling how folder names are displayed, you have the power to create your perfect setup.
*   🧠 **Smart Defaults:** While highly configurable, the app comes with sensible defaults so you can be productive right out of the box.
*   👆 **Your Workflow, Your Rules:** Adjust everything from video playback speed to confirmation dialogs and default folder selections to make CleanSweep truly your own.

### Powerful Duplicate Finder
Free up gigabytes of space by getting rid of unnecessary copies.
*   🔎 **Finds Exact & Similar Media:** CleanSweep detects files that are 100% identical, as well as photos and videos that look visually similar (like burst shots or trimmed clips).
*   🎛️ **You Control the Similarity:** Choose your desired level of "sameness" (Strict, Balanced, or Loose) to fine-tune the scan and get the results you want.
*   🗑️ **Smart Deletion:** Tools like "Keep Oldest" or "Keep Newest" let you clean up entire groups of duplicates with a single tap.

### Smart and Fast Performance
*   ⚡ **Finds *All* Your Media:** CleanSweep performs a deep scan to find media files that other apps might miss, ensuring nothing is overlooked.
*   🚀 **Optimized for Speed:** By smartly caching information, future scans become significantly faster. The app is designed to get you organizing without the wait.
*   ⚫ **AMOLED-Friendly:** A sleek, true-black dark mode that looks great on any screen.

## Privacy First
We take your privacy seriously. CleanSweep is designed from the ground up to respect your data:
*   **Completely Offline:** The app works without any internet connection.
*   **No Tracking or Analytics:** We don't collect any data on how you use the app.
*   **Your Files Stay Yours:** Your photos and videos are never uploaded or shared. All processing happens securely on your device.
